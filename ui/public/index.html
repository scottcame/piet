      Polyfills have to be added manually here. Because babel has to transpile node_modules to convert ES6 code, we cannot
      rely on babel to also apply polyfills, because of circular dependencies and problems (learned by doing) with core-js
      (both versions 2 and 3) with IE 11.

      So, to generate polyfills, go to polyfills.io and choose ES6 and anything else we need, then download the resulting
      polyfill bundle and include it here.

      Also, IE11 requires the WebComponents polyfill. To get that, npm install @webcomponents/custom-elements and grab the
      min.js and sourcemap into this directory.
